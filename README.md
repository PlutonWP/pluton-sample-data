# Pluton WordPress Theme Sample Data
This is the sample data files for the <a href="https://plutonwp.com/" title="Pluton WordPress Theme" target="_blank">Pluton WordPress Theme</a> and has been made accessible for buyers.


You must extract the zip after downloading and select only the file you wish to import, which will depend if you are importing main sample data, sliders or theme options.

## Important
The demos were created with Visual Composer, Revolution Slider and the <a href="https://plutonwp.com/extensions/" title="Pluton Extensions" target="_blank">extensions</a> of the theme, so if the plugins/extensions are not enabled on your site before the import, you will not have all pages as presented in our demos.
There will be no errors on your site if you do so, if you have other plugins that replace those used in demos (as Elementor Page Builder instead of Visual Composer) and you want to import a specific page, you can do it..
